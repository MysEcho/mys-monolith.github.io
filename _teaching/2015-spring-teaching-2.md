As the President of RoboVed(Robotics Club of PTU), I along with the other office bearers, conducted the RoboVed Summer School where we conducted online sessions for incoming club members on different topics of mobile robotics, ROS and Machine Learning. I believe that ROS is fundamental for anyone who is interested in Robotics beacause of its modularity. Our sessions included discussions about History of Robotics, Introduction to Robot Operating System and Coordinate Transforms, and Introduction to Machine Learning and then Hands on tutorials with Gazebo. It was so much fun and all in all I think I learned more than I had to teach.
