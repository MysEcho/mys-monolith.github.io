I acted as the Teaching Assistant of Prof. Dr. R. Elansezhian for the graduate-level "MT 213 Industrial Robotics" course. I helped arranging the course-work and designed several assignments on the topics of Mobile Robotics like Transformation Matrices, Localization, Path Planning Algorithms. 

I like discussing new stuff with my friends so we talked at lengths at algorithms like DWA, RRT*, TEB, Voronoi etc. while we already had learnt Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in our Data-Structures course.
