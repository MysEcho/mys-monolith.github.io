excerpt: 'Real-Time Image Processing involves the transformation of incoming signals, primarily from a camera, into a format that can be readily interpreted by a display device. This process is heavily reliant on precise timing constraints, demanding efficient hardware execution. This paper proposes an innovative method for interfacing the OV7670 Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Camera with an FPGA-based Real-Time Image Processing system on a Zynq 7010 platform, using the open-source Digilent Dynamic Clock Generator. The architecture is characterized by itâ€™s parallel processing capability of both controlling the camera output signals and processing the signals and converting them from RGB to DVI format on the fly. In lieu of the traditional PLL based clocking wizard, which provides a fixed clock signal, the open-source Dynamic Clock Generator has been incorporated in the architecture to generate the essential pixel clock, meeting the real-time clocking requirements. The RGB to DVI(Digital Visual Interface) block has been coded in VHDL to convert the output from AXI4-Stream to Video Out Xilinx IP Core to TMDS (Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling data, to be interpreted by an HDMI compatible monitor.'
