I am a Robotics Researcher at **Nanyang Technological University, Singapore** interested in **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**. Currently I am working at the **Algorithmic Robotics Group(ARG) @ NTU Sg** on novel Embodied AI and Computer Vision problems. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at **Robotics Research Center (RRC), International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT H)** where I worked extensively with **path-planning algorithms** using generative modeling and optimal control. In the future, I would like to work on Visual Social Navigation for robots and deploy them in public spaces. I envision a future where robots are not just tools, but collaborative partners in our daily lives, enhancing human capabilities and improving quality of life.
