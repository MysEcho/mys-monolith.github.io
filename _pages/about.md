I am a Robotics Researcher and I work mostly with Path Planning Algorithms. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at Robotics Research Center (RRC), International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT H). Previously, I have worked extensively with Reconfigurable Computing and Embedded Systems. I love making robots and giving them a brain. 
In the future, I would like to work on Social Navigation for Mobile Robots but with condition to a lot of social cues including both perceptive and semantic. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to develop and deploy autonomous robots capable of learning to coexist harmoniously with humans. I envision a future where robots are not just tools, but collaborative partners in our daily lives, enhancing human capabilities and improving quality of life.
