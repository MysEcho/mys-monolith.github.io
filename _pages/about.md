I am a Robotics Researcher interested in **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**. I will be attending **Nanyang Technological University, Singapore** starting August 2025. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at **Robotics Research Center (RRC), International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT H)** where I worked extensively with **path-planning algorithms**. In the future, I would like to work on Visual Social Navigation for robots and deploy them in public spaces. I envision a future where robots are not just tools, but collaborative partners in our daily lives, enhancing human capabilities and improving quality of life.
