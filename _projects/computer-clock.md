During my freshmen year of college, I was heavily interested in Electronics and I was also greatly inspired by Ben Eater's 8-bit computer just using logic gates. I built an 8-bit computer clock like him. This implementation uses 3 NE555 Timers to create 3 kinds of clocks - Astable, Monostable and Bistable.
