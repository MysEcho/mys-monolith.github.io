This is a Persistence of Vision Display project that I worked on, again, in the freshmen year of college. I taught myself Embedded C and especially AVR Programming while in high school. I had actually made this project several times but for some reason I forgot where I kept the other implementations. 

Anyway, back to topic. This project uses an ATMega 8A microcontroller (part of the family of AVR MCUs, ATMega328P is used in Arduinos) to interface 8 LEDs and alternately toggles them in such a sequence such that when in motion, it imitates some text. This is very common and can also be found in many Chinese toys but all in all, a fun project to make.

Btw, I wrote "PEC" which stands for Pondicherry Engineering College (they changed the name later to Puducherry Technological University after I joined.)
