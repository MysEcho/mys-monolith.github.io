Another simple project that can be put together in less than an hour. I made this project as a part of my departmental mini project in the fifth semester. A funny story about this project is that, I was unaware of the fact that the deadline for our departmental mini project and when I suddenly came to college one day I saw everyone ready with their projects. However, I knew, the problem statement was something that I can tackle in less than an hour. ONLY PROBLEM was that I did not have a LASER!! So I borrowed an IR Module and an Arduino instead from my juniors at the Robotics club, fired my laptop and wrote the code to build a home automation system in fifteen minutes. 

Well, I later went on and used a Laser instead of an IR LED, so I think it technically counts.
